# Bookshelf-API

this is a project from the Dicoding course, building a Bookshelf API. This API can store books, get information about all books or one book by entering the ID, editing and deleting books. There are also several additional features that can request information regarding books currently being read or unread, finished or unfinished, and books that contain the keywords entered.
